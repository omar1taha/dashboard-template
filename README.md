This project is developed with
# React + TypeScript + Vite

Please Note:
- Use `npm i` then `npm run dev` to run the project
- No api was given so Mock api was used 
- React query latest was used and a mock api `https://dummyjson.com/users` to fetch data in table (Its users not domain however it illustrates the idea)
- Material UI and Material Joy were used however their Datatable component is very far and poor to customize.. I've always used tailwind/primereact so its not fancy as figma design
- React Forms is used and submit function has form data without api
